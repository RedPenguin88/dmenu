# My Personal Build of dmenu

This build of dmenu has been expanded upon to match my personal, opinionated preferences â€” suckless philosophy be damned.

# Patches

- [Border](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/border/): Adds a border around the dmenu window
- [Case Insensitive](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/case-insensitive/): Makes dmenu case-insensitive by default, replacing the case-insensitive -i option with a case sensitive -s option
- [Center](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/center/): Centers dmenu in the middle of the screen
- [Fuzzy Highlight](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/fuzzyhighlight/): Fuzzy matches gets highlighted
- [Fuzzy Match](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/fuzzymatch/): Adds support for fuzzy-matching, allowing users to type non-consecutive portions of the string to be matched
- [Mouse Support](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/mouse-support/): Adds basic mouse support
- [Numbers](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/numbers/): Adds text which displays the number of matched and total items in the top right corner of dmenu
- [Password](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/password/): Don't directly display the keyboard input, but instead replace it with dots
- [Prefix-completion](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/prefix-completion/): Changes the behaviour of matched items and the Tab key to allow tab completion
- [Vertfull](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/vertfull/): Prevents dmenu from indenting items at the same level as the prompt length
